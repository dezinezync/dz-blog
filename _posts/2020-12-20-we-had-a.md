We had a "Rotation and Torque" topic in Physics during school. 

I never understood it properly back then. Fourteen years later, I finally get it thanks to this episode by Dianna (AKA Physics Girl). 

I follow her videos on Youtube for the variety of interesting physics topics and experiments she does. 

But her latest Physics 101 series is really bringing back the fascination I once had for physics.
