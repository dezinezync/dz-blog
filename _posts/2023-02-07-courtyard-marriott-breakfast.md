After unsuccessfully attempting to fall asleep last night, thanks to absolute lack of sound-proofing at the hotel room, I found myself waking up to a phone call from my aunt for breakfast. 

I did eventually fall asleep and slept like an elephant, after being tired from working from 6am. to running an event till 11pm without any breaks. 

But I was ~~pleasantly surprised~~ delighted to see the breakfast spread offered at the hotel. 

My wife got herself buttermilk pancakes:

And I got the Eggs benedict

I haven't seen either of these being offered as an option even at the most upscale hotels in Pune, but a business hotel outside of Pune has these, and they nailed both of it.

Off-topic, I really dislike how overly processed these photos look from the iPhone 14 Pro. Yuck! I assure you, the food looked much more appetizing in person.
