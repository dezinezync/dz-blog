Humans are inherently self-sufficient beings with a certain position in the food-chain. We can cook for ourselves, clean our modest dwellings, ourselves and our belongings, grow our own food. 

There are some who specialise in certain things: medicine, surgery, smithing, construction, agriculture, husbandry, poultry, and the list goes on. 

However, overtime, we forgot that we are self-sufficient and started to overtly depend on others to provide us cooked meals, clean for us, maintain for us. 

We are now bound by the limits of our homes, or wherever else we happen to be. Suddenly, a lot of people are finding themselves stranded. That is never a good place to be. 

But you can get up. You can become self-sufficient. You can learn to provide for yourself to the best of your abilities. And whenever you need help, don't be afraid to ask.
