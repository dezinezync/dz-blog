Frightening image of the scope of Internet Shutdowns in India. 

Dissenting voices (and their amplification) are suppressed on social media by completely blocking internet access in affected (by what though?) regions. 

This has also affected online education for students joining in remotely during the pandemic and internet businesses (a lot of them who started setting up ecomm stores during the pandemic). 

All of this, to suppress dissenters. I guess it’s now, “you can silence the idea temporarily, but never kill it”
