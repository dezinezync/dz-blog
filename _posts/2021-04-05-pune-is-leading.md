Pune is leading the charts for new COVID cases and by a huge margin. 

From the statements of various officials, it seems like all ventilators are now occupied. Two individuals have already lost their lives because they could not get one in time. 

This isnâ€™t about April 2020. This is about April 2021. The exact same situation. All over again. 

At least 2000 people are fined daily for not wearing masks. This is incredibly disturbing trend and every time I think about it, I tend to lose my mental balance.
