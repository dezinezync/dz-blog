I don't remember the last time we had cool, moist mornings in Pune. 

New time restrictions has also reduced the traffic on roads with most jobs going back to work from home. 

Feels like a loop starting again (from last year's April). 

PS: Pune has the most number of COVID cases in India. It is brutally scary to venture out even for the smallest of tasks.
