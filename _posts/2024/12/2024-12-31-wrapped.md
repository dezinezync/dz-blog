**2024** has been the most exciting year for me since the 2020 pandemic and lock downs! 

My wife gave birth to our son, who's proven himself to be the absolute best thing, yes: all parents say this about their kids, and they're all right.

But what's better is I've found a new purpose for blogging. I've seen some bloggers do weekly journal writings on their blogs, and I thought this to be a good fit, to help me write on the blog more, and maintain a journal, a public journal! 

This comes with a caveat: I can only write things I can post publicly. But that's a great thing for me. It'll help me be more mindful, and more thoughtful when I write. 

I hope to post the first recap on the 5th of January, 2025, the first weekend of 2025. I'm really excited for this, and I hope I can get all 52 weeks covered, and form a habit. 

I hope you have a very happy, healthy, mindful, and peaceful 2025!
