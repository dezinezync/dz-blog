So I've missed out on writing for about 7 weeks, which isn't surprising. I've been working on my apps and since the new operating system releases from Apple in early September, my schedule has been all over the place. 

A lot of amazing things have happened since then, and I've been writing, but just on different blogs (for my apps!) Here's a list, in chronological order:
- [A Decade of Elytra](https://elytra.app/blog/2025/08/21/a-decade-of-elytra/)
- [Elytra September 2025 Release](https://elytra.app/blog/2025/09/12/v2025-9-0-for-ios-and-macos/)
- [Pockity September 2025 Release](https://pockity.app/blog/2025-09-12/release/)
- [Swift New Era for Elytra](https://elytra.app/blog/2025/10/01/swift-new-era-for-elytra/)
- [Pockity October 2025 Release](https://pockity.app/blog/2025-10-15/release/)
- [Pockity October 2025 Release - Behind the Tech](https://pockity.app/blog/2025-10-15/technical/)

That's a lot of words, and I'm especially proud of the latest article I wrote, full of HDR images and videos. It's something new I've tried and I'm really happy with how it turned out. 

Now that both of my apps are updated, I think I'm going to take a break from new features, and resume work on Incise. Time to get it out of its alpha status into beta. 

I've also, very recently, figured out how to post HDR photos to Instagram, and other social web which supports it. This has been a game changer for me, for how I shoot, edit, and process images. I'll continue to tweak my process to bring greater fidelty to my images, and this only make sense: More and more modern devices bring support for display-p3 and higher domain colour spaces to the device screens. If we're not taking advantage of this, and continue to stick to web sRGB, we're leaving a lot on the table.

Another thing I've done during my interim break from writing here: two new Youtube videos! Pick which ever fancies you, or if you have some extra free time, watch both ;) 

Both of these were filmed on my iPhone 16 Pro, and edited on my Macbook Pro. It's something new I'm exploring and practicingâ€¦
