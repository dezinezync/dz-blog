It was Diwali week, and what began on the Sunday of the previous week, with celebrations with the family throughout  the week finally culminated in a busy, packed, weekend! Family dinner with cousins on Friday, a store opening on Saturday, and finally a short trip with the kiddo and wife on Sunday. 

The store opening I referred to, is a new spot my by sister-in-law's brother, and is located in Kharadi. I haven't explored this part of town in a long time, so I was pleasantly surprised how well it have developed in the last 6 years. Wide roads, excellent footpaths, parking spaces, small places to sit and linger around. 

Amongst all that, this new building, which seems like it's yet to be leased out, caught my eye! The cloudy weather made for an excellent photograph of it. I don't know what it's called, but I sure as heck would love to visit it some day.

Today, we woke up at 5am, got ready, and started driving towards Kasarsai Dam, located just outside Pune MR. My mum told me this region was a drought prone area back when she was a little kid. Now, it's lush with farmlands, fisheries, and everything else a small dam enables.

Here's my video of the place, just long drone shots, with no voice over. Enjoy!
