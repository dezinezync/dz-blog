I had a very strict plan for this week: Release [Pockity v2025.10](https://pockity.app/blog/2025-10-15/release/), any releated patch updates, and the same for Elytra. Once both of these were updated, I wanted to get some major updates pushed to [Incise](https://incise.app) I've been meaning to work on for a while. 

I've always enjoyed carefully planning out my "work hours", allocate one-two hours per task at-most, and see how much I can get done in that period. If it's going to take any longer, I stop, and move on to the next thing on the list, and come back to the longer tasks the next day. This gives me a fresh start, a fresh context to look at my existing work and spot potential errors, and work more enthusiastically. I dread working on the same thing over multiple hours on end, I quickly lose focus, interest, and will to progress. 

It took me a whole week to finish everything, and now I can finally enjoy a full-week off with the family. I hope to take advantage of the less traffic in the city and around town, to go visit a few sites I've been meaning to go for a while. If I do, gear up for photos next week ;)

But for this week, I have this one to share, the new foot-bridge at the [Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Udyan Metro Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZRCCzKp8vLBMq78i8). I shot this on my iPhone 16 Pro in RAW, and edited in Photomator for HDR.
