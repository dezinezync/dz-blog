I recovered, but thing's aren't any better. It continues to get hotter every day, and humidity keeps coming and going on a whim! It won't even rain here, which is the most annoying thing. All the icky bits of surviving the humidity and none of the benefits. 

But, since I was feeling better, friends and I decided to catch up! This time, we tried a new place called [Halloumi](https://www.zomato.com/pune/halloumi-2-kalyani-nagar), which serves Moroccan and Mediterranean cuisines. I love a good hummus and grilled meats! Pita bread is my third favourite bread (just after Butter Naan and Ciabatta). So my hopes were high, and it did not disappoint.

The Grilled meats platter turned out to be my favourite! Paired with the hummus, it was a great combination. So if you ever find yourself there, do try this combo out. You don't even have the get the whole platter, just any grilled meat of your choice and the hummus! 

The next day, I had some work in another part of the district, so I called up a friend and checked in to see if we could meet later during the day. Luckily, his wife and him were available, and up for some grub! On his way to our rendezvous point, he saw a food mall (akin to Hawker centers of Singapore), which we decided to try out. Surprisingly, decent wood fired pizzas and soya chaaps! 

But what caught my eye was how well this place was made, very similar to a Hawker center, but with the additions of a children's play area outside, but a lack of parking area.

If you're ever around the area of Kokane Chowk, PCMC, you should definitely try spotting the place and trying out. It's also hosts a projector screen (they were playing some cricket match highlights) and a small stage, if you're hosting a small birthday party or some other event there.
