It's been another terrible week with really bad weather, impacting my health. Been dealing with hyper-acidity, lethargy, and headaches. 

Spoke to my aunt earlier today, and she informed me things aren't so bad in their part of the city. In-fact, I was in PCMC a few days ago and it was delightful in the evening, with cool winds blowing throughout the two hours I was there. 

The winds here, if any, are hot! They will dehydrate you within minutes. Lohegoan being one of the hottest spots in the state this summer, is directly contributing to these hot winds. To make matters worse, there was a big tree-felling drive in Koregoan Park late last year, further contributing to [heat island effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island). 

And now with the RFD ([River Front Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_Riverfront)) Project going on, I suspect things are going to get a lot worse. There's just a lot of political and bureaucratic chest thumping, and congratulating each other over these projects, with little to no actual insight on how these things impact the city.
