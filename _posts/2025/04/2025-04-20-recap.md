Earlier in February, my cousin sister took an impromptu trip with her friend to Hong Kong! So on her way back, I asked her to get a good bottle of whiskey, to which she obliged, but in return: she wants pizza! 

After multiple weekends of cancelled plans, this was finally the week! A drab, and hot, evening quickly turned into a fun family evening... 

Baking pies in a charcoal/wood oven is one of my favourite activities! *I could do this all day* kind of thing!

Here are some shots of these:
