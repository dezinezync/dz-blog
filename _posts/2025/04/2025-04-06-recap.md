Nothing worth noting down in a weekly recap has occurred this week. I, too, couldn't put much efforts into anything happening. The heat and humidity has severed my normal functioning, with my blood pressure dropping randomly. 

Working towards recovering from this quickly, I see no other bet than sitting in an air conditioned room all-day, while I helplessly watch climate change take its desired path. Sounds weird, is weird, and is absolutely true.
