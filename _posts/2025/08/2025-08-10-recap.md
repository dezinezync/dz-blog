A very busy week working on updating my two apps, [Elytra](https://elytra.app), [Pockity](https://pockity.app), and my web app [Incise](https://incise.app). The first highlight however was making pizzas in the middle of the week!

We also celebrated Rakshabandhan on the weekend, my two sisters visisted us, and we had a nice family lunch after almost a year! I missed this very much. Later on the weekend, my wife and kiddo were away and the rest of us visited the mall for a quick stroll. 

I encountered a bunch of new art pieces (the only reason I even visit this mall), as well as a work in progress by the talented [Asavari Lingade](https://www.instagram.com/rangoli_with_asavari) for the upcoming Indpendence Day celebrations.

These were my favourite sights at the mall this afternoon, and I spent all my time where while my folks shopped. 

Finally, lots of good food has been had. Good food, a good time, and good sleep, my trifecta for a good week.
