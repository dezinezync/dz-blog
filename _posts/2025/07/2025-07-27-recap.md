I've been resting for most of the week, regaining my strength and then some, to be ready to run around with the kiddo again! 

Being a dad is demanding, and nobody told me about this, I love it! ðŸ˜„

My uncle and aunt celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary last week, however they were vacationing in Masai-Mara at the time, and now that they are back, they decided to host our family and theirs at a family resort. I've been looking forward to this for a while now, because I've been meaning to take the kiddo out and about in the monsoon, and this was the perfect time. 

We made our way to the resort, and the kiddo, my mum, and wife peacefully slept through the car ride. As soon as we crossed over to the windward side of the western ghats, the rains took over the landscape. My uncle showed me a new route to the resort which completely bypasses the city traffic, and leads straight to the resort's path, handy! 

Upon arrival, our rooms were being prepped, so we decided to explore the place. Now I've already been here two weeks ago, so I know what's where, and carefully avoided to take the kiddo near the stream and swimming pool, however, this didn't last long! Soon enough, my uncle took him to the stream and now he wants to jump into the stream, lil' dude can't even swim ðŸ˜„

If you'd like to see some more photos of the place, see [my previous post](/2025/07/13/recap).

It feels good to finally be out of the bed, up and about, and spending time with the family again. During the previous week, and this one, I've mostly been isolated away in my room to avoid spreading whatever infection I had.
