Following up on my movie run, I watched Superman this week. What a fun, entertaining movie. I really don't get the hate it's been getting. Superman isn't really a popular hero with the likes of Batman and Spiderman here in South-East Asia. The other two completely dominate the scene along with anime characters like Naruto, Goku, and Vegeta. 

I have decently sized expectations from James Gunn's DCU now, and really looking forward the Supergirl movie due next year. Mr. Terrific stole the show for me, right after the intense, long, scene of Louis interviewing Clark at her apartment.

I also took some time off, gathered my usual suspect of a friend for a short trip, and we visited a resort not too far from town. The weather was incredible, and it really put into perspective for me, why I loved the Indian monsoon. 

After a haitus of 5 years, this was my first monsoon trip since the 2020 pandemic. First three years of lockdown, then another year with my wife's pregnancy, and last year with the baby, I simply could not make time to venture out. After a few failed plans, I finally decided to solo it, and invited my friend to tag along if he could, which he did! 

In the following photos, do not mistake the clouds for fog. That isn't fog, those are clouds dipping into the valley from the surrounding hills.
