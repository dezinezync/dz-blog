I watched the F1 movie at the theatres this week. This is the first movie I've watched at the local, newly renovated, cinema hall. It was an absolute blast, and I had so much, I once again remembered why I enjoyed watching movies there. 

It's a two minute drive or a five minute walk from home, lots of cheap, paid, parking, good seats, and great sound! This is contrast to another cinema hall we'd had to visit in the past, which is just a 3km ride away, but it would take at least 25 minutes to drive to, find parking, and get to the elevator. On a bad day or during rush hours, 45 minutes are gone just doing all of this. And then the same duration, usually more, when exiting and returning back home. Now the whole ordeal takes me 10 minutes.

I've been meaning to capture a specific shot of a flower at sunset, but repeatedly failed to. Today, during my evening walk with the kiddo, I finally managed to get it. Kiddo in one hand, iPhone in the other. All other times, I was by myself with both hands firmly grasping the phone. I guess I was underestimating myself, and today I just let go and finally got the shot!
