We had to rush the kiddo to the hospital last weekend, for an emergency, and admitted for observation for a night. **WORST** panic situation we've faced so far as parents. 

He's recovered and back to being the lively and cheerful self. It was so dreary seeing him all curled up in bed for a few days. 

Tough week, finally behind us.
