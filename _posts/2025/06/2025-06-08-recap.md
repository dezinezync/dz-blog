Yay! The kiddo and wife are back home, after their two-week long summer holiday. I met them briefly, earlier in the week, but it's so good to have them home again. An observation about the kiddo: The moment he was home, he made sure everyone is present, akin to a teacher taking attendence in class, and then proceeding to immediately stick to me, refusing to let go. 

It's not something I expected, especially at his age, and I'm glad, relieved, and surprised it happened. Now that I have had two full days to spend with him, I do realise that distance does make the heart grow fonder, even in kids his age!

Now that June has begun, I've been actively seeking new contract work for iOS and macOS apps! If you're looking for a developer with over 10-years of experience working on Apple platforms, send me an email using the contact link in the header. This could also be server-side work involving NodeJS or Swift on Server (Vapor).
