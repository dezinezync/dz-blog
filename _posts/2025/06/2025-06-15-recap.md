It's WWDC week, which means I've been completely occupied following session videos for the upcoming releases of iOS 26, macOS 26, and others... 

It's been a very exciting week, so many new things, I feel the same excitement I did back a decade ago. I'm hopeful again, as this "flat design" non-sense can finally be put behind us in another year or two!
