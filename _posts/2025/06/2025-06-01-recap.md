We had a trip planned with my cousins this week, however, on the day of the trip, I wake up at 3:30am, with no sleep in sight again, we called off the plan. I didn't want to take the risk of driving on an expressway, in the rains, with a kid in the car. Too many variables suggesting I shouldn't. 

One thing we did not consider, at all, was **very** heavy rainfall. For the two days we planned to be out, it rained so much at our destination, it would have been very difficult not only to get there, but also engage in any activities there or simply relax. 

Then, the rains reached us in the city! These are some of the deadliest downpours I've witnessed in recent years, and global warming will keep making things worse. The rampant deforestation happening around the city is enabling the winds to move through the city undeterred. So many instances of flooding (poor city planning and administrative response), trees falling on parked vehicles, and in one instance, a lady lost her life to a tree falling on her. No resignations, no press briefings, just words of wisdom for the general public, with weather warnings coming three hours after the storm!
