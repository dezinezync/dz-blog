The kiddo is completely fine now, fully recovered, and back to being himself, wrecking the house furniture and more! Feels good. 

We finally managed to take a break from it all, and visit our favourite dinner buffet in town, and as usual, the kiddo kept the staff in good spirits and cheerfully engaged throughout. They even gave him a lovely gift.

The next morning, he and I finished all four of those within a few minutes.
