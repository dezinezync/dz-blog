Happy 76<sup>th</sup> Republic Day to all my fellow Indians! 

I'm finally closing in on my first audio book, after having started it exactly two weeks ago! It's a trial, but I'm getting a hang of it. 

The next book I'm looking forward to is: [The Son also Rises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Son_Also_Rises_(book)) by Gregory Clark. I've been really fascinated by the subject this book explores, Social Mobility, something that's been witnessing a downtrend in India. 

The kiddo is learning new things now, rapidly, and my wife and I are having trouble keeping up with him already. It's an overload of cuteness and seratonin.

I also took the opportunity to tweak the blog layout a little, you'll notice some changes if you're viewing this in a browser. It's much nicer to read, and easier on the eyes. 

Lastly, today being a dry day, no alochol is served at restaurants, bars, etc., my mum wanted to try out this new place called [Oi Brewhouse](https://www.zomato.com/pune/oi-brewhouse-kalyani-nagar&ved=2ahUKEwj7neiZgJWLAxX5T2wGHa0YK-gQFnoECDoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0-OBmHbj-DOnAMLTFLxTHQ). 

It's great food, and beers (when served) with really uncomfortable seating. But luckily for us, they are showing the live stream of [Coldplay's Ahmedabad](https://www.hotstar.com/in/shows/coldplay-live-in-ahmedabad/1271387971/live/watch) concert.

The dessert was obviously something I was looking forward to: Smores, caramel popcorn, chocolate mousse, vanilla ice-cream, all sitting atop of a biscuit and salty crips of some sort on the side. Yum!
