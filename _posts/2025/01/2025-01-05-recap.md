I had envisioned writing weekly recaps to be a lot simpler in my head, but when I *sat* down to write this, it's a lot harder. People who have been doing this for years have my utmost respect!

Here's an excerpt from **The Seen and Unseen Episode 387** that really clicked with me:
<blockquote cite="https://seenunseen.in/episodes/2024/6/24/episode-387-the-life-and-times-of-the-indian-economy/">
The pessimism of the intellect has to be matched by the optimism of the will.

I've been dealing with a serious backlog of podcast episodes, and I have no intention of fast-forwarding it. I listen to them at 1.5â…¹ speed during my evening walks. Fast-forwarding to the latest episode would mean I would miss out on lot of interesting conversation and *knowledge*.

It was just my mum and I at home to celebrate New Year's eve, so I baked a few pizzas and we relaxed watching the usual programming on Indian television ðŸ˜„

My Macbook Pro M1 Pro's Apple Care has since expired as well, and unfortunately, unlike the US, Canada, or some European countries, Apple does not allow renewing Apple Care directly online through their [checkcoverage](https://checkcoverage.apple.com) website. 

This is quite unfortunate, as I plan to continue using this incredible computer for a few more years. I'll probably give Apple Support a call in the coming week to figure this out.

I've been making steady progress on [Elytra](https://elytra.app) and [Pockity](https://pockity.app)'s upcoming releases. I also plan to spend some time today on [Incise](https://incise.app), adding support for multiple-images in a post, and being able to edit posts. 

I've been making micro tweaks to Incise's UI, having recently shared the finalised [Logo](https://incise.app/posts/16) for the service. Now that I have federation and ActivityPub + ActivityStreams working on it reliably, I can spend more time bringing this to a v1 launch sometime this year.
