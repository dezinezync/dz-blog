- Iâ€™ve been refactoring tests for an app, and they are written in Objective-C. Being able to navigate these classes with ease, and then trying to run a `map`, `filter`, `reduce` on an `Array` feels weird ðŸ˜†

- We celebrated two birthdays this week: a family friend, and then my brotherâ€™s. He turns 27 this year. Almost hitting that 30 mark!

- I havenâ€™t been listening to any podcasts this week, been incredibly tied down by work, personal responsibilities, and spending time with the kiddo. 

- Iâ€™ve been thinking of starting to listen to audio books when I work. Help with focus. Any Mac apps which lets me play audio books? Even a web app will do. Donâ€™t want this on my phone, not yet. If you have any recommendations, any genre except for Lifestyle, Entertainment (thinking Celeb lifestyles), and Science Fantasy, please email me your recommendations.

And to end the week, my friends, wife, and kiddo, visited [Boteco](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d10123062-Reviews-BOTECO-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html). They revamped their menu last year, and weâ€™ve finally been able to schedule a date this week when all of us could get together. Before I say anything more, some food photos first:

At first, I had my eyes set on the lamb my friend ordered, and it looks delicious as you can see, but as soon as my steak arrived, I wanted nothing else! 

I had a good steak after almost 10 years! And that's a very long time to go without a good steak. I hope to revist the place again, and try their other steak offerings, paired with a beer!
