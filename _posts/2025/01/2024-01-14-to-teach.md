I recently ordered some tea bags from TWG. They arrived with a beautiful postcard. Whenever I get these, I post them to my cousin, who lives in the same city. I do this because he loves postcards too! 

I realised something: kids today perhaps don't know what these are, what to write on them, how to post them. Maybe I am wrong, but I do doubt that. Either way, I'm going to teach my kiddo on how to write and post these, and we'll continue to send them to our cousin. 

He's going to love it! I'm eagerly waiting for that day!
