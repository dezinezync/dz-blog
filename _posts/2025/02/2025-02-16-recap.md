I finally took the opportunity to go on a mini-vacation (Stay-cation as some call it) and it was liberating. This is the kiddo trying to grab things he still can't eat üòÑ

I announced the general availability of [Incise](https://incise.app) yesterday, so I need to keep an eye on things, make sure everything was going smoothly. So I setup a corner for myself in the room. It wasn't very comfy but that's alright, as I didn't plan to spend too much time there.

<p>From our room, I spotted a parking space and noticed a sizable solar installation. I'm glad to see more and more establishments using available space to generate power from that distant nuclear reactor.</p>

We also had the opportunity to taste some amazing food, and this time, the kiddo joined in on the feast as well! We've recently started to introduce him to lightly sweet and salted foods, so almost everything on the menu was game for him!

The Matcha Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e was the obvious highlight! I love the Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e here, and a matcha infused one just sealed the deal to make it the top dessert on my personal list!

Post dinner, I sneaked a quick photo of them enjoying the skyline, and the calm waves on the pool.

So obviously, the next day, we had to take him to the pool which he enjoyed more than me. 

Refreshing, yes! Expensive, yes! Put a price on it? Absolutely not!
