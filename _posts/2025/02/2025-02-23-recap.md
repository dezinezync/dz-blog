The eighth week of the year has just conluded and I still haven't managed to complete listening to two full audiobooks. I started **The Son Also Rises** but have been having a hard time to make this in to a habit. I need to figure out a new way to make me do this. Open to suggestions ;) 

I've had a mostly uneventful week, with lots of coordination between multiple people waiting on me to get things done, last weekend's get away has been really useful. 

The kiddo and I did contract a cold, and while he's already feeling better, I am not. I don't feel terrible, not yet anyways, and hope this subsides. 

I did have an [engaging conversation](https://mastodon.social/@hiway/114051708219228199) with a fellow ActivityPub(ber) on Mastodon, only to be bombarded by replies by some fanatic and ruining a healthy conversation. It really irks me when this happens, I don't engage with such people and instead just block them. I am not ruining my peace for someone's misguided, unscientific, and biased beliefs. 

*I'd rather sit down and listen/read when other people are conversing and I have nothing constructive to contribute.*
