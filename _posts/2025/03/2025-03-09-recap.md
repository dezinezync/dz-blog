I really do not have anything to write about this week. It started off with my wife's birthday, lots of excitement, joy, and family time spent well together. And then it all tapered off, really quickly, until today. 

Next week is my kiddo's first birthday, and I'm fortunate to be able to share my 32nd with him! 

Count your blessings, I sure am!
