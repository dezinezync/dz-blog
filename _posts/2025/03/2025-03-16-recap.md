It was, finally, our birthday week! The kiddo turned a year old, and while he didn't understand the significance at first, as soon as people started to video call and wish him, greet him, he knew something was up.

It was when we cut a cake infront of his great-grand-mother, he knew it was a special day. His reaction was special! And while I do not have it on video, I'm sure to remember it for a very long time. 

I also recieved a suprise visit by a dear friend, who spent a relaxed evening with us, all the while as we sipped our favourite TWG tea. That was a good evening, and a good week.
