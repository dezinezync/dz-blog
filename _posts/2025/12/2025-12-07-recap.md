Ah! The final month of the year, the weather is finally cooling down, the humidity has gone off to hibernation, there is a crispness in the air. Everything is good! 

I've been slowly and surely making my way to creating a new iOS app, ready for alpha testing in January of 2026. Really looking forward to the initial reactions from people. It's an app designed for India, and will be released only in India. 

But most importantly, yesterday, the wife and I celebrated our sixth wedding anniversary. Six years, three of which we spent in lockdowns. We remarked how some of our best travel years were spent locked up in our home, but to no regret! Our best travel years are now ahead of us, as we eagerly look forward to traveling with our son. 

He's definitely taken a liking to traveling and exploring new places already, loves hotel rooms of all kinds, cabins, lakes, mountains, the calm wind and the blistering monsoons! 

This was also the first time he tried fish and prawns, and he enjoyed both. I like where this is going!
