To our genuine surprise, the kiddo's Aadhaar number was generated and ready by Monday itself. It took the system just under 48 hours to assess information and assign an ID to him. I still stand by what I wrote in my [last week's post](https://dezinezync.com/2025/12/14/recap), and now I can continue to complete the enrollment process for my child. 

If you have ideas on how we can collectively work to simplify this for underprivileged families or families with little to no technology education, I'm happy to hear! Drop me an email. 

With this process completed, I can finally get back to finishing the alpha release of my app, and bringing it closer to the beta phase. It's nearly done, and I don't trust I'll be getting any or much work next week, so it's full steam ahead! 

My family is away on a trip this week, so I have more time by myself, letting me completely focus on getting this done, or enjoying more DotA2. We'll see which one it ends up being 😜
