FIFTY-TWO WEEKS of journaling! A task I had set out for myself at the end of 2024, a challenge really, to see if I am able to start something new. Another challenge was to listen to more audio books but I failed at that within the first two months itself. I'm not too disappointed by that, as I've found I really like journaling. So I'll be continuing with this. 

It puts me in a certain headspace that I've come to like, and even enjoy the process. I've quickly become fond of sharing photos here, and while the interaction is lesser than I had hoped, it doesn't bother me. I'm doing this for me, and whatever engagement I've received was purely organic since I never shared links to these posts anywhere. 

My in-laws took us out for a nice Christmas dinner, followed by a weekend trip to their farmhouse! I've managed to capture amazing drone footage there, and I'm looking forward to editing and posting these soon to Youtube and Instagram next week! 

Happy Holidays, and have a fantastic 2026!
