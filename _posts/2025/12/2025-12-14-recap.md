During the week, my brother happened to be around the school we are looking to get the kiddo admitted to sometime in 2027. To our surprise, he's actually eligible already, and the admission process will be beginning shortly. 

So as soon the admissions were open on Wednesday, I quickly rushed to fill up his form. This is my Alma mater, and my brother's admission (back in 2003) was the first time the school moved to online only admissions. 

However, one thing stood out like a sore thumb: The admission form required an Aadhaar number for the child as well! This is ridiculous! 

Children should not have to enroll into this bogus system just to get their right to education. And no, this isn't about my child, but the welfare of all children in the country. MAjority of the population still does not have equitable access to these systems, so expecting them to enroll and posses one is simply infringing on their right to education. 

Oh well, I must submit to their rules for now, so on Friday, we headed out to get him enrolled and let's see how long this takes, hopefully it's quick and without any hurdles.
