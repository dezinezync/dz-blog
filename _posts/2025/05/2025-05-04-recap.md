Last week, I wrote about how my health hasn't been great! This directly coincided with my last few working days at BusyMac! 

Luckily, our HR recognized I have a couple of paid leaves remaining, and I was able to avail those. 

As I was dealing with all of this, I stuck to my original plan of spending as much time as I could with the kiddo! It worked out great... We've developed new interactions, I've had the opportunity to see him learn how to eat by himself, albeit shabbily at this point, but I can only assume he's going to quickly get a grasp on this, as he does with most other things. 

Seeing him waddle around the house now brings me immense joy, and ducks being his favorite bird at the moment, it's poetic! 

I hope next week, I feel better, and am able to finally start getting out and about, and meet friends I've kept waiting for the past two weeks...
