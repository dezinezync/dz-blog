Yes! Yes! Yes! I've finally been feeling better, all thanks to the improved weather. It's cooler now, helping my body regulate temperature better.

No! No! No! Two, nuclear capable, countries are now at war, and I'm staying in one of them. The conflict is currently kinetic, and non-nuclear, and seems like something triggered nuclear talks from one side, but intervention from a third party seems to have helped cooler heads prevail! 

Tensions are high, at the borders, for civilians, and for diplomats. So far, India's reaction seems to be rational, but the same cannot be said for our unhinged media reporting the situation. 

It's not unbelievable the matter has escalated this far, anyone who knows about the history of the Indian sub-continent knows that diplomacy here is all held by strings, very thin, fragile, strings. But it's holding up so far, and I hope it continues, for the sake of all people involved in the conflict, civilian and non-civilian alike, but the terrorists can f***ing go to hell!
