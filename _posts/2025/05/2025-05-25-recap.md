I've been taking a break from all work, and as fate has it, my wife is traveling to her parents place with the kiddo. 

Now this would have been a great time to relax, however, my mind decides: this is a great opportunity to engage in intense MOBA games. 

And that's exactly what I did. I was so disconnected from the everything else, completely zoned in, only ever stepping away from the desk for food breaks, and watching the pre-monsoon showers. 

While this may seem odd to some, I missed this, and I enjoyed it. It reminded me of my teenage years playing at cafes after high school (junior college). And it certainly helps me maintain my good hand-eye coordination as well as my reaction times. 

When the kiddo is around, he's fascinated by the computer. He sees the lights breathing, the water pump and fans randomly (from his perspective) ramping up and making wierd noises, and then insists on doing something on the keyboard! I'm always tempted to put the headphones on him, but as I'm unsure of the audio levels, and what levels are suitable for their tiny eardrums, I avoid.
