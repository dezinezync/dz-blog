Today was the Swift Pune inagural meetup, and it was a successful event! 

During the event, I unveiled a new logo for the community, leaving behind geographical constraints from the previous logo, and embracing vibrant colours, just like all the people who attended the event from across the state.

I also composed the logo into wallpapers for Apple Devices which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/07bpPj9fGczkarJEYFR42pdPA#Wallpapers).

I'm so happy to have been part of this event, coordinating, and helping the core members best achieve their tasks!
