Now that the first Swift Pune Meetup was behind me, I decided to take a much needed break, winding down on Monday and Tuesday, and eventually going out with the family into the Sahyadri hills for the next few days. This was a fantastic break, and we stayed at the Unwynd property's Unbound cabin. The sunset and sunrise, chill in the wind, dinner by a bon fire, and discovering new things with the kiddo was of the utmost fun! 

I got a decent few shots, at night, with the iPhone as well, and continue to be impressed by its long exposure capabilities. I wish I had a tripod to take 30 second exposures, but that was have been more work than it was worth.

I made a video about it all, which you can watch here:
