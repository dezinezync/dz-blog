Today, I met a group of strangers whom I was connected to online and through Developer Relations at Apple. 

We met for breakfast, and discussed plans to start **Swift Pune**, Pune's first and only meetup group focused around Apple Platforms engineering, mentoring, and focusing on knowledge sharing. 

We were able to quickly identify our personal strengths, and take up responsibilities for ourselves, and start planning our first event.
