<p>Since 2016, Iâ€™ve been working on <a href="https://elytra.app">Elytra</a> and was the Lead Developer &amp; Designer at <a href="https://shyplite.com">Shyplite</a>.</p>

<p>Shyplite was a good opportunity for me to explore domains like <em>managing teams</em>, <em>product roadmaps</em>, <em>scaling products</em> at an exponential scale amongst other things. Over time though, the environment became increasingly stagnant for me.</p>

<p>So at that point, I did the obvious and resigned from my post at Shyplite to look into iOS/macOS opportunities.</p>

<p>I did decide to take a break for 3 months to recuperate from mental exhaustion, which in hindsight was a fantastic idea. It gave me ample time to also slowly work on Elytra&#8217;s v2.4 release for iOS and iPadOS 15.</p>

<p>Since september though, I&#8217;ve been actively looking for a new job with little success. Most companies either ghosted me after the initial application, interview or phone call. I managed to get through a few which were some of the most ridiculous interviews I&#8217;ve been in (heck, one guy didn&#8217;t even understand what I said about RunLoops and told me I was completely wrong ðŸ˜‚)</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want to rush it though. I wanted to work on some good apps, work at a place and with people who can help me grow myself professionally, and give me enough time for personal growth. And luckily, being patient helped me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy to let you know that I&#8217;ve decided to join the BusyMac and 2Do team starting tomorrow.</p>

<p>These are some fantastic apps with a very long history. I&#8217;ve grown up with these apps and now I get a chance to work on them.</p>

<p>Elytra (and soon Pockity) won&#8217;t be going anywhere. They won&#8217;t be going into maintenance mode. They will be actively developed, supported and will get scheduled releases as always. The macOS 12 release for Elytra is ready and I&#8217;m waiting for Apple&#8217;s signal to submit it. Pockity will soon enter its private beta followed by a public beta cycle.</p>

<p>There are lots of people I want to personally thank, but there are just too many of y&#8217;all (see how incredible you all are). So thank you for supporting me, and I appreciate your continued support, words of encouragement and some really amazing reviews (and even the funny ones) on the AppStore.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s to us! ðŸ¥‚</p>
