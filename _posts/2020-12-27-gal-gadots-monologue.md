Gal Gadot's monologue was wonderfully delivered by her (perfectly suits Wonder Woman).

Pedro Pascal's "overacting" of an ex-TV star felt real. 

The Cheetah plot felt out of place. Even some of the Cairo scenes. 

Patty Jenkins won't be doing WW3 until she finishes the Rogue Squadron movie, IIRC. She also posted something about the script for it and reworking it considering the 2020 pandemic. I hope that gets her enough time to make a more cohesive script like the first one.
