<p>I took my own <a href="https://dezinezync.com/2020/02/11/on-quitting.html">advice</a>. Not entirely by choice. But I did it.</p>
<p>Today, at 7:30PM, I completed 24 hours without smoking a cigarette. I broke a 10 year long habit. </p>
<p>I am going to continue going to my same spot every few hours just to catch a breath of fresh air. And I am going count to 20 (a pack of cigarette). Every time I complete 20 visits, I’m going to put money equal to the cost of a pack in an envelope.  </p>
<p>This is how I am going to start my retirement fund. \o/</p>
