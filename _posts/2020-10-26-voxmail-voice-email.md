[Voxmail - Voice Email with Siri](https://tyler.io/voxmail-voice-email-with-siri/)

I personally don't have use for such an app, but I found it very interesting. 

It might interest you if you find yourself checking email when driving (I don't recommend you interface with anything else when you're driving) or doing other daily tasks with your earphones plugged in
