I edited a photo today after several months. My teacher from college is doing a session sometime later this week and this is the exercise. 

I'm guessing he shot the photo somewhere near Salt Lake City given the landscape. 

Being stuck at home for over a year, and then editing a wide landscape shot: Feels so good.
