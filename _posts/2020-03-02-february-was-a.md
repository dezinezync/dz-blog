February was a very interesting month for me. My February challenge was a bunch of 15 minute exercise routines. 

Not too bad, I thought. Until I was to actually execute them. But the feeling afterwards, the energy that lasted the entire day, is what I seek now. 

The Apple Watch has had a more positive influence on me than I had previously imagined. It dragged my out of my depression, it put me into a regular exercise regime and made me want to put healthier calories in my body. 

Technology is truly wonderful when you use it for its intended purposes, and the people who make it possible are just amazing people.
