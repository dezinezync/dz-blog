<p>The MacBook Pro 14” continues to impress me. </p>
<p>I now wonder if my wait of 7 weeks was worth the 32GB upgrade. I have not even reached the 16GB threshold after running Sketch, FCP X and Xcode workloads on it (separately). </p>
<p>Perhaps once I start a Resolve project in it for colour grading work, I might see it using more RAM. </p>
