It took my 3 years to finally get the golden medal for a month. 

Being able to beat constant procrastination to workout, move around more, and actually engage with physical activities has been incredibly motivating (and exhausting some times). 

The Apple Watch is still one of the best devices I've purchased in the last decade when I consider the value for money. 10/10.
