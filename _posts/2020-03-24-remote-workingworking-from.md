Remote Working/Working from Home isn't for everyone. It works for some people, some people make it work, and for the rest: it just doesn't work. 

You may find yourself not focused,  procrastinate more, less motivated, constantly distracted. 

That's alright. That's okay. Everything around you is already laced with chronic anxiety at the moment. Don't let this add to it. Take it easy, take it slow. 

Once we get through this, you'll be back in your natural work environment, where ever it is.
