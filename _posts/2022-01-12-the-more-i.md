The more I use `async/await` in Swift, the more I believe it to be an obvious inclusion. 

Back-porting it was the right choice, hopefully accelerating its adoption. 

`withCheckedContinuation` is a great addition which is going to help with adopting a lot of the non-async methods and functions from 3rd party libraries. 

Exciting times ahead.
