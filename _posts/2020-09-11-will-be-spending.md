Will be spending a good part of my Saturday creating better rules in Mail.app to categorise my email either automatically or manually (using the *Apply Rule* option). 

I need a much much improved system for this. Receiving 30 updates from Github itself with repos across 4 orgs induces an odd feeling I definitely do not like. Need those emails away from my eyes until I decide to look at them.
