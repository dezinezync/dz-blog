For the past two weeks, I've been waking up earlier than I normally do. My wife sleeps later than I, so I can't begin working early as I fear I might disturb her. 

Unintended consequence: I now have some free time in the mornings: just me, my Macbook and Micro.blog & RSS feeds. Good way to spend the winter mornings.
