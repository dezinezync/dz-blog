Arun wrote on [his blog](https://www.arun.is) about the macOS System Preferences app and its design over the years and several macOS versions ( wasn't it Mac OS a few years ago?). 

Very interesting read. Being able to visualise the changes over time like this really puts the hard work the Designers & Developers, over at Apple, put into their craft.

**PS**: I haven't mentioned this before, I really admire the design of his blog and the time he puts behind every single post.
