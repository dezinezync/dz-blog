Sounds good. I've enabled it for now, but I think I'll eventually migrate to AWS' WorkMail or Fastmail.

## What if I use G Suite legacy free edition for personal use?
If youâ€™re using the G Suite legacy free edition for non-commercial purposes, you can opt out of the transition to Google Workspace by clicking here (requires a super administrator account) or going to the Google Admin console. You can continue using your custom domain with Gmail, retain access to no-cost Google services such as Google Drive and Google Meet, and keep your purchases and data.
