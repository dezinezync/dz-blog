I finally have a working build of Elytra with a mix of Swift and ObjC code for the main app. All of the data, models, and networking is now in Swift. A few of the View Controllers have also been migrated to Swift. 

The main coordinator for the App is due next. Combine and Codable have really made my life easier.
