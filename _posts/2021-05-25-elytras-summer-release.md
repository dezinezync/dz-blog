<p>Elytra’s Summer 2021 Release has been one of the smoothest releases I’ve had for an app in recent memory.</p>
<p>I wrote three posts about the release on the app’s blog:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>About the release itself and the general availability of the update. <a href="https://blog.elytra.app/2021/05/18/elytra-summer-2021-update/">Link</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About the availability of notarised builds of Elytra for macOS. <a href="https://blog.elytra.app/2021/05/18/elytra-notarized-builds-now-available/">Link</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About the two bug fix releases I did over the past one week. <a href="https://blog.elytra.app/2021/05/25/bug-fixes-available-for-the-summer-2021-release/">Link</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m glad I got all of this through before WWDC itself. I can not sit back, relax a little till WWDC week, and then after it is over, sit down to plan what’s next for Elytra on iOS &amp; iPadOS 15, and macOS 12.</p>
