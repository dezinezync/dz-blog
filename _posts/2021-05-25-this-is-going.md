<p>This is going to be my first year at WWDC where I will understand most presentations.Â </p>
<p>Since the last few years, most of the presentations at WWDC involved Swift code (unless itâ€™s about Metal, or any of the Core Frameworks).Â </p>
<p>I had take screenshots, try and understand whatâ€™s happening and translate it to Objective-C.Â </p>
<p>Not anymore! Iâ€™m now a bilingual Apple Platforms Developer ðŸ¥³ and Iâ€™ll be able to follow along just like most of you all.Â </p>
<p>Iâ€™m very excited for WWDC this year. Letâ€™s get going!Â </p>
