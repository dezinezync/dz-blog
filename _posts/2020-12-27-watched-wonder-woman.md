Watched Wonder Woman '84 last night. The movie was mediocre on its own (not comparing to the first one), but when Steve comes in the first few scenes: I realised how many modern things we take for granted. 

I'd like to keep this spoiler free, so I'm just going to say: I'm grateful for planes and rockets and RADAR. ðŸ˜Š
