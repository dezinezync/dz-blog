First impressions of the MacBook Pro: that display is something else. 

The first image of an HDR clip pinned to 1000 nits (HLG limitation). The rest of the UI is at the brightness set by me (3 stops below 50%). 

I exposed the shot in the camera app such that the brightest spot in the shot does not clip at the highlights. ðŸ¤¯
