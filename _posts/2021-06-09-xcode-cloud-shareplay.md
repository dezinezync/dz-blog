Iâ€™ve been thinking of how Xcode Cloud and SharePlay could play together to bring local iOS programming and simulation to iPads. 

You write all code locally, commit to a hosted (by Apple) git repo, your app is built and then streamed from a remote device of your choice, back to your local device. 

SharePlay seems like the kind of tech which is similar in nature to what some of the streaming gaming services do (eg. Stadia, Xcloud, Geforce Now, etc). So it should be feasible. 

Apple was very clear with their communication: Xcode Cloud will go into production later next year. That gives them enough time to iron out all the edges of building apps in the cloud, then streaming them down to our local devices.
