I made my first ever sour dough bread, my first ever baguette, and I am very happy with how they turned out. 

For my next batch which I'll be making tomorrow: I want to improve on the shape and the scoring. I wasn't very confident today and ended up not scoring deep enough. 

Not all is lost though: they taste amazing and my house smells incredible.
