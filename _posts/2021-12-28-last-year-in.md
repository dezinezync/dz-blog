<p>Last year, in its last week, I ordered a coffee machine. I put that transaction on a no-cost EMI plan with my card vendor. </p>
<p>That was the last EMI I setup on the card, or any of the cards I have. </p>
<p>My new year’s resolution for 2021 was achieving financial independence. No more EMIs, pending card bills or similar credit items.</p>
<p>And I’m happy to write that I’ve successfully done it. It was hard, and tricky, especially considering I had no active source of income for about 3 months. </p>
<p>Careful planning, tracking expenses using <em>Pockity</em> (something I’m building when I get some free time) and budgeting helped me get through the year. </p>
<p>Looking forward to another year, and for as long as it takes for this to be become a habit. </p>
