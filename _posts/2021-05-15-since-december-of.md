<p>Since December of 2020, I’ve started to sleep earlier than I used to. It’s been mostly great for me. I wake up early, get some of my best work done between 7AM to 9AM and I end up with a lot of free time on my hands in the evenings which has also enabled me to play a game or two of Badminton with my brother.</p>
<p>An unexpected side-effect of this situation is that I am no longer awake when the apps I submit to the App Store for review go into the “In Review” state, get approved or rejected. I am no longer able to experience that sudden rush of anxiety, wonder and anticipation. 😅</p>
