Since December of 2019, I'd been really looking forward to today, the Annual September Apple Event when Apple launches new phones. 

My iPhone X of almost 3 years is showing its age. I was looking forward to upgrade it. Seems like that isn't happening today, but I have my fingers crossed that Apple launches at least the non-Pro phones today.
