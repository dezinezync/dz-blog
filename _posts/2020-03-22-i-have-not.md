I have not heard so many birds all chirping and singing for at least 15 years. 

I can hear possibly a car or two every 15 minutes which breaks the harmonics. Apart from that, sunny day, nice breeze and the birds doing their thing.

I got a few recordings which I am sharing under a Creative Commons License [Link](https://github.com/dezinezync/Audios/tree/master/Birds%20Audio)
