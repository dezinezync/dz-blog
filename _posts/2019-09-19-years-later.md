<p>I recently posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/dezinezync/status/1173472372143190016">Twitter Thread</a> about completing 10 years working professionally, making websites, iOS & iPadOS apps. </p>
<p>During those 10 years, I learnt a lot. My entire career’s catalyst has been and will continue to be blogs by some wonderful folks. </p>
<p>Keeping with cycle of reading and writing, I’ve decided to dedicate some time (at-least a couple of times a week to begin with) to writing on my blog. This blog. So hello there, it’s nice to meet you. </p>
