The first time I implemented **Sign In with Apple**, it took me roughly half a day to get it working. 

Implemented for a another website today and I was up and running within 10 minutes. Itâ€™s only hard the first time I guess. 

If you havent used it on a website on your iPhone or iPad yet, find a website that supports it and give it a shot. Fun & Fast.
