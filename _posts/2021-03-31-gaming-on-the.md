Gaming on the iPad is about to get its biggest boost in the last couple of years with the launch of iPadOS 14.5. 

Game controllers have been supported for a while but being able to use the latest gen controllers is a game changer. 

I've been playing Samurai Jack and Pathless over the last couple of weeks and it's been fun. Haptic feedback is currently missing but I believe as soon as iPadOS 14.5 is out, we'll be seeing updates from game developers who care about these things. 

Coupled with WWDC coming up later in June, the future for gaming on the iPad looks bright.
