<p>This is it. This is the worst possible manifestation of the idea, but this is probably what we needed to get the Govt. &amp; RBI and Apple working together to bring Apple Pay to India.</p>
<p>People are going to be afraid to touch payment terminals, ATM machines for a while. I am. Just the other day, I was running out of food for my cats, so I went to the pet store to get some. I insisted that I use the NFC mode to make the payment.</p>
<p>If we do get Apple Pay, I am certain Google will follow suit and bring their own system in place. Phones with NFC are ubiquitous now.</p>
<p>I am keeping the  Watch out of this scenario for now as not many people own them here.</p>
<p>Dear Apple and Google, let’s get this done. Please.</p>
